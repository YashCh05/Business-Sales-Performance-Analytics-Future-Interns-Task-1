# Business Sales Performance Analytics  
### Future Interns – Data Science & Analytics Task 1

## 📌 About the Task
This project is completed as **Task 1 of the Data Science & Analytics Internship by Future Interns**.

The objective of this task is to simulate a real-world business analytics scenario where a data analyst is required to:
- Analyze raw sales data
- Identify revenue and profit drivers
- Discover inefficiencies and loss areas
- Translate data findings into actionable business insights
- Present insights using a professional, client-ready dashboard

The focus is not just on visualization, but on **solving business problems using data**.

## 🏢 Dataset Background (Business Context)

The dataset represents a **retail business operating across multiple regions in the United States**, selling products under categories such as:
- Technology
- Furniture
- Office Supplies

Each row represents a **product-level transaction within a customer order**, including:
- Sales, profit, discount, quantity
- Product category & sub-category
- Customer segment
- Geographic region
- Order and shipping dates

This data reflects a typical **retail / e-commerce sales environment**, where management needs clarity on profitability, growth trends, and pricing strategy.

## 🎯 Business Problem Statement

Despite having detailed sales data, the business lacks clarity on:
- Which products and categories drive revenue vs profit
- Which regions perform best or underperform
- How discounting affects profitability
- Which customer segments are most valuable

**Goal:**  
To analyze sales performance data and provide **data-driven insights** that help the business:
- Improve profitability
- Optimize discount strategies
- Focus on high-performing products, regions, and customer segments

## 🔧 Project Pipeline & Tools Used

### 1️⃣ Data Cleaning & Preparation – *Python (Google Colab)*
- Loaded raw CSV data
- Standardized column names
- Converted date columns into proper datetime format
- Validated numeric columns (sales, profit, discount, quantity)
- Ensured data integrity (no missing or corrupted values)
- Created time-based features (year, month)

### 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – *Python*
- Analyzed sales and profit distributions
- Evaluated yearly sales trends
- Identified category, sub-category, and regional performance
- Studied the impact of discounting on profitability
- Analyzed customer segment contribution

Python was used to **think through the data and validate insights**, not just create charts.

### 3️⃣ Business Visualization – *Power BI*
- Built a **4-page interactive dashboard**:
  1. Executive Sales Overview  
  2. Product & Category Performance  
  3. Regional Sales & Profit Performance  
  4. Discount Impact & Customer Insights
- Created KPIs using DAX
- Designed clean, minimal, business-focused visuals
- Enabled filtering for deeper analysis

- **West and East regions** outperform others in both sales and profit.
- Discounts above **30% consistently erode profitability**, indicating a flawed pricing strategy.
- The **Consumer segment** contributes the highest sales and profit, making it the most valuable customer group.
